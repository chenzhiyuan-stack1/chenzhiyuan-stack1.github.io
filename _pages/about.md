I am _Zhiyuan_, a first-year master student supervised by [Prof. Chenglin Li](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=17). Before that, I received my _B.S._ degree in _Information Engineering_ at [SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in _June, 2023_. My research interests lie in _Reinforcement Learning_.

In my spare time, I love:

 ☑ Playing the _clarinet_🎷 and the _trumpet_🎺.

 ☑ Playing different ball sports, like _basketball_🏀, _badminton_🏸, _table tennis_🏓, and _billiards_🎱.

 ☑ Watching _NBA_🏀, the _Premier League_, _Bundesliga_, _La Liga_, _Serie A_ and _Ligue 1_⚽️, and _Grand Slam tournaments_🎾.

 ☑ Learning the frontiers of military and politics.🚀
